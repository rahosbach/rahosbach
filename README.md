Hi, Iâ€™m @rahosbach.  Thanks for checking out my portfolio!

I'm currently pursing a graduate data science from UC Berkeley's School of Information (expected graduation in May 2022).  I'm interested in the entire data lifecycle, from figuring out the best way to ingest and store data, to conducting full-scale analyses and providing insightful visualizations.  You'll find repositories here that contain some of my projects from graduate school, as well as some open-source contributions I've made and stand-alone personal projects.

Please reach out if you would like to collaborate on anything or have questions/suggestions on my work: robert.hosbach@gmail.com.
